/****
 * Shim Vite configuration file
 *
 * Why this file exists:
 * 1. Tools such as **shadcn/ui** verify a project by searching for
 *    `vite.config.{ts,js}`. Electronâ€‘Vite, however, names its main config
 *    `electron.vite.config.ts`, so those CLIs fail to detect Vite and abort.
 * 2. This file is therefore a *verbatim* copy of `electron.vite.config.ts`
 *    whose only purpose is to satisfy frameworkâ€‘detection logic.  Electronâ€‘Vite
 *    itself does **not** load or rely on this shim at runtime.
 *
 * How to maintain:
 * â€“ Keep the plugin lists, aliases, and any other build options in sync with
 *   `electron.vite.config.ts`; they must remain identical to avoid divergence.
 * â€“ If Electronâ€‘Vite adds new sections (e.g. `worker`), reflect them here.
 *
 * ðŸ‘‰  Never import this file in application code. It exists solely for
 *     thirdâ€‘party tooling that expects the canonical Vite filename.
